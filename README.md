# Ignite Shop

This is the fourth challenge of the Ignite Bootcamp: an online clothing store that integrates with Stripe. The primary goals here were to learn how to connect my shopping cart with a payment processing tool and to explore Next.js, a new tool introduced in the course for learning React.
